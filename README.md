# Analysis 

### Breakdown of Customers

A significant number of users are Subscribers (just over 3/4). These subscribers make the most use of the bikes and are the main source of income. A marketing campaign to incentivize subscribing to the service while simultaneously making the service accesible to anyone would be the best course of action. For example: a user friendly app for one time users and providing special rates to subscribers. The bikeshare users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8.
